# Student-Result-Analysis-Management-System
The Student Result Analysis Management System allows users to select a specific regulation and view detailed student results, including marks and pass/fail status. Users can also see summary statistics and a pie chart representing registered, appeared, passed, and failed students.
Admins can upload and integrate new student data files, and modify existing data to ensure accuracy. The system uses frameworks, with a database such as MySQL, and includes security measures for authentication and authorization.
